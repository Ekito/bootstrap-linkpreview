# Link preview plugin for Twitter Bootstrap

A simple link preview js library using Twitter Bootstrap styling components.

## What does it do?

bootstrap-linkpreview.js is a JavaScript library offering a facebook-like preview for URLs. It's very simple to use and it's just a few Ko.

Usually you would like to process that kind of things on a server but sometimes you can have no other way than doing it locally. The main issue with local ajax calls is that it will return the exception:

``
XMLHttpRequest cannot load *â€¦* Origin : * is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
``

It is due to the [Same origin policy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy) concept.

## Demos

The best way to know how to use this library is to go through the examples in the folder `demos`. You have here several ways to go through the same origin policy.

### php-proxy

This example demonstrates how to use the library from a website. It simply filters every jQuery ajax calls and echoes it on the server. That way the ajax call get the results back. To run the code, simply upload the demo on your server or run a local Apache server.

Thanks to [this thread](http://stackoverflow.com/a/12683591/334209) for the php script.

### chrome-extension

The advantage with Google Chrome extensions is that it gives a way to bypass the same origin policy. To run it, follow [these steps](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.html#unpacked).


## How to use bootstrap-linkpreview?

Call the library via javascript:

```javascript
$('.element').linkpreview()
```

$('.element') can point to `<input>`, `<textarea>` or `<a>`. Without any parameters, this will load the URL(s) and generate the preview just after the element(s).
