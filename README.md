# Chrome extension - Link preview

This is a sample use of the (soon to be released) library bootstrap-linkpreview.js.

## What does it do?

bootstrap-linkpreview.js is a JavaScript library offering a facebook-like preview for URLs. It's very simple to use and it's just a few Ko.

## Why a Chrome extension?

The process we use to preview links is full client-side. We are using any backend solution to display it. This was first developed for a client developing a Chrome Extension. It was easier to work in that context as a first approach.

We will release a much simpler example very soon.

## Any documentation?

This is a TODO. We will release a documentation in another repo dedicated to the js library.
